# Memento-App
This application was created using C# language in Visual Studio (.Net Framework) and is used to create tasks, either personal or for work. Also, there are 2 categories of people: employee and admin. The admin can modify, delete or add accounts and can send tasks with different tags (e.g. urgent) to the employee, and he can track them in the "Employee Task" section. In the Admin section, a calendar is included in which personal or work tasks can be added along with the date and time. All tasks, employees and events are saved in a local database created using Microsoft SQL Server Studio.
